                    Andrew and Tristan Tate were both professional kickboxers
                    and are now fully dedicated to helping young men break out 
                    of the matrix, regain their lost masculinity and amass a great
                    quantity of wealth. The brothers are widely hated by the common
                    person because their nonexistent and superficial values are being
                    attacked at all fronts by the Tates' words. Born in the USA, raised in the UK, their current residency is Bucharest, Romania.
                    Part of their daily routine is chilling with women, smoking cigars, driving their expensive cars, flexing on the broke boys,
                    running the most influental global network The War Room and being top Gs.
